# Face Predictor and Generator

## Overview
In this project, I have analyzed the BBC News Dataset from Kaggle by conducting Data
Preprocessing and Named Entity Recognition. I implemented Information Retrieval using TF-IDF and Word2Vec for article
search and recommendations. Applied Topic Modeling with Linear Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Clustering Algorithms (KMeans, Hierarchical & DBSCAN) to identify key topics in the dataset. Used the Hugging Face Transformers model to summarize articles in a timespan.
